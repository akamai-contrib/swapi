# Installation

## Pre-Requisites

### XCode:

	xcode-select --install
&nbsp;

### PIP

Make sure **pip** is installed:

	$ pip -V

If pip is not installed, install it:

	$ sudo easy_install pip
&nbsp;
## Automatic Install

SWaPI should AUTO-INSTALL itself. Yes, you heard that well!

Requirements file should get auto-generated when running SWaPI for the 1st time. In the future, I might need to update this and install new libraries for proper operation.

&nbsp;
## Manual Installation

If you still want to do this process manually, or having any issues, use pip to install all of the following libraries (as a recommendation, use the '--user' flag when installing each library):

nose==1.3.7
xlrd==1.2.0
pandas==0.24.2
requests==2.18.4
texttable==0.8.7
pyopenssl==17.2.0
dnspython==1.15.0
Pygments==2.2.0
paramiko==2.3.1
edgegrid-python==1.0.10
XlsxWriter==1.1.1
beautifulsoup4==4.6.0
pyfiglet==0.8.post1

# Download SWaPI (latest v3.1)

Clone GIT:

	$ git clone ssh://github.com/akamai-contrib/swapi


&nbsp;
# Credentials

SWaPI uses the standard Akamai OPEN credentials file, .edgerc. By default, it will look for credentials in your HOME directory.

You can override which section to use with the '--section' option, which can be sent on each SWaPI command.

To set up your credential file, see the [Authorization](https://developer.akamai.com/legacy/introduction/Prov_Creds.html) and [credentials](https://developer.akamai.com/legacy/introduction/Conf_Client.html) sections of the [Get Started](https://developer.akamai.com/legacy/introduction/) guide.
